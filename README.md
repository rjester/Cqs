Cqs
===

Overview
------
A high performance Cqs architecture implemented in MVC using Dapper, Entity Framework, Simple Injector and claims based authorisation.

To Run
------
1. Update the configs to point at your Sql Server instance - configs that need updating are in Cqs.PerformanceTests, Cqs.Tools.DatabaseCreator and Cqs.Presentation.Web. Run the Cqs.Tools.DatabaseCreator - this will create your database, and add some sprocs and data.
2. Install Cqs.Presentation.Web into IIS and enable windows authentication and disable anonymous access. Other wise the Claims Transformer will not execute.
3. Browse to the index of the site which is /Customers
4. Run the performance tests by executing - Cqs.PerformanceTests
